The code in this repository implements a backtracking algorithm that can be used to verify the claims of the above paper involving computational searches. The verification can be done by running the file `verify_backtracking.py`.

In addition, code is provided to verify the proof of Lemma 3.10, which is partially omitted in the paper. The verification is done by running `verify_forbidden_factors.py`. Please consult the code for the details.
